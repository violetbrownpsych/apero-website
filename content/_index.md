I'm Violet, and I'm a Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Psychology Department at Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/psychology/) I work with the [Carleton Perception Lab](https://www.carleton.edu/perception-lab/) along with [Dr. Julia Strand](https://www.juliastrand.com/). Our research focuses on how people understand spoken language, but we're also interested in Open Science and research transparency, psychometrics, statistical methods, and undergraduate teaching (of course!!)."
