<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a Visiting Assistant Professor of Psychology at [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/), and along with teaching, I study spoken language processing with the wonderful [Carleton Perception Lab](https://www.carleton.edu/perception-lab/). Below you'll find a little more information about who I am and what I'm interested in. :grinning:
