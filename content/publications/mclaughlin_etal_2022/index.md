title: "Revisiting the Relationship Between Implicit Racial Bias and Audiovisual Benefit for Nonnative-Accented Speech"
subtitle: "Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics"
excerpt: "Speech intelligibility is improved when the listener can see the talker in addition to hearing their voice. Notably, though,  previous work has suggested that this “audiovisual benefit” for nonnative (i.e., foreign-accented) speech is smaller than the  benefit for native speech, an effect that may be partially accounted for by listeners’ implicit racial biases (Yi et al., 2013, The  Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 134[5], EL387–EL393.). In the present study, we sought to replicate these find- ings in a significantly larger sample of online participants. In a direct replication of Yi et al. (Experiment 1), we found that  audiovisual benefit was indeed smaller for nonnative-accented relative to native-accented speech. However, our results did  not support the conclusion that implicit racial biases, as measured with two types of implicit association tasks, were related  to these differences in audiovisual benefit for native and nonnative speech. In a second experiment, we addressed a potential  confound in the experimental design; to ensure that the difference in audiovisual benefit was caused by a difference in accent  rather than a difference in overall intelligibility, we reversed the overall difficulty of each accent condition by presenting them  at different signal-to-noise ratios. Even when native speech was presented at a much more difficult intelligibility level than  nonnative speech, audiovisual benefit for nonnative speech remained poorer. In light of these findings, we discuss alternative  explanations of reduced audiovisual benefit for nonnative speech, as well as methodological considerations for future work  examining the intersection of social, cognitive, and linguistic processes."

Speech intelligibility is improved when the listener can see the talker in addition to hearing their voice. Notably, though,  previous work has suggested that this “audiovisual benefit” for nonnative (i.e., foreign-accented) speech is smaller than the  benefit for native speech, an effect that may be partially accounted for by listeners’ implicit racial biases (Yi et al., 2013, The  Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 134[5], EL387–EL393.). In the present study, we sought to replicate these find- ings in a significantly larger sample of online participants. In a direct replication of Yi et al. (Experiment 1), we found that  audiovisual benefit was indeed smaller for nonnative-accented relative to native-accented speech. However, our results did  not support the conclusion that implicit racial biases, as measured with two types of implicit association tasks, were related  to these differences in audiovisual benefit for native and nonnative speech. In a second experiment, we addressed a potential  confound in the experimental design; to ensure that the difference in audiovisual benefit was caused by a difference in accent  rather than a difference in overall intelligibility, we reversed the overall difficulty of each accent condition by presenting them  at different signal-to-noise ratios. Even when native speech was presented at a much more difficult intelligibility level than  nonnative speech, audiovisual benefit for nonnative speech remained poorer. In light of these findings, we discuss alternative  explanations of reduced audiovisual benefit for nonnative speech, as well as methodological considerations for future work  examining the intersection of social, cognitive, and linguistic processes.
