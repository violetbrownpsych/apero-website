      <title>An Introduction to Linear Mixed-Effects Modeling in R</title>
      <link>https://www.violetabrown.com/publications/brown_2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>This Tutorial serves as both an approachable theoretical introduction to mixed-effects modeling and a practical introduction to how to implement mixed-effects models in R. The intended audience is researchers who have some basic statistical knowledge, but little or no experience implementing mixed-effects models in R using their own data. In an attempt to increase the accessibility of this Tutorial, I deliberately avoid using mathematical terminology beyond what a student would learn in a standard graduate-level statistics course, but I reference articles and textbooks that provide more detail for interested readers.</description>
